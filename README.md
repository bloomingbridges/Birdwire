Birdwire
========

A twitter client for birds. (Arduino + Processing) - Birdhouse not included!

This repository holds the Arduino sketch that collects bird pecks via a sound sensor, a Processing interface for fine-tuning and interpreting pecks as Morse code, plus the functionality for converting input into human readable text and submitting it to our _@birdwire_ twitter account.
